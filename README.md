# full-ish-stack-sentiment-analysis

### README is WIP.

3 layer Convolutional model trained on IMDb dataset. 

As this was my first "full stack" project I wanted to keep it relatively simple and quick by using a Convolutional model. I will later explore using a BERT or most likely XLNET architecture from the Hugging Face team.
