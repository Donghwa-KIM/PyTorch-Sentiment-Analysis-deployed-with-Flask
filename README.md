# Full-ish Stack Sentiment Analysis

3 layer Convolutional model trained on IMDb dataset (will use a different dataset soon), using GloVe pretrained word embedddings.

As this was my first "full stack" project I wanted to keep it relatively simple and quick by using a Convolutional model and deploying it on Heroku using Flask. I will later explore using a BERT or most likely XLNET architecture from the Hugging Face team and deploying it to AWS to gain experience.

If you want to check out my deployed version you can head to [sentiment.oliverproud.com](http://sentiment.oliverproud.com). Note: the server will take around 30 seconds to wake up. 

If you have any questions, feedback or problems of any kind, get in touch by messaging me on [Twitter - @oliverwproud](https://twitter.com/oliverwproud) or submitting an issue.
